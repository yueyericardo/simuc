## _Restricted Hartree Fock (RHF)_ for simple Atom (He and Be) using _Slator Type Orbital (STO)_ with _Double Zeta Basis_ in Python

Integral calculated by sympy

It will be better to understand if you have read *Levine, Quantum Chemistry, 7th Edition, chapter 11 and 14*.  
There is an example calculation of Helium atom at page 412-414.
